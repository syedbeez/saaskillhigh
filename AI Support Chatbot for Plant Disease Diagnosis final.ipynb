            "You: use gemini\n",
            "Gemini: Nematode wilt isn't a single disease with one cause.  Instead, it refers to wilting in plants caused by root-knot nematodes (genus Meloidogyne) or other nematodes that damage the plant's root system. These nematodes aren't directly causing the wilting in the same way a fungus or bacteria would through a specific toxin.  Instead, their feeding activity on the roots causes:\n",
            "\n",
            "* Root damage: Nematodes puncture the roots, creating feeding sites called galls or knots. This disrupts the flow of water and nutrients to the plant.\n",
            "* Reduced root function: The damaged roots are less able to absorb water and nutrients from the soil.\n",
            "* Secondary infections: The damaged roots are more susceptible to secondary infections from soilborne fungi and bacteria, which can further weaken the plant and contribute to wilting.\n",
            "\n",
            "So, \"nematode wilt\" describes a symptom (wilting) resulting from a nematode infestation, rather than a specific disease itself.  The wilting is a consequence of the nematodes' impact on root function, often exacerbated by other pathogens.  Different plant species exhibit varying degrees of susceptibility and wilting severity.\n",
